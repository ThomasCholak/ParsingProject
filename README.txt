Lexical anaylzer which reads code from the user (via an input file in a Linux server) and then outputs the corresponding tokens for that file.
This information is valuable for parsing and compliation since it allows for the compiler to have information on what is being utilized by the program.

To run this file, import these files into a linux file system and run the 'make' command. This will generate a file named 'P1'.

You can then type './P1 testScanner.txt' and it will then analyze the file 'testScanner.txt' for data and create the corresponding tokens. However, this program
will work for any input file entered by the user, you will just have to create the input file first and then it can be imported.
